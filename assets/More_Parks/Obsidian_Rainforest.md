## Park Description
Obsidian Rainforest Reserve preserves a living laboratory of ecological succession following historic volcanic eruptions. Towering Sitka spruce emerge from nutrient-rich ash deposits, while geothermal vents create microclimates for rare thermophilic fungi.

The park's "Fog Catcher" initiative harvests atmospheric moisture to sustain delicate ecosystems during drought periods. Nighttime "lava tube lantern tours" reveal hidden quartz crystal deposits.
