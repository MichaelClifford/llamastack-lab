## Park Description
Crimson Basin Desert Preserve protects one of North America's most pristine desert ecosystems, where towering saguaro cacti stand sentinel over shimmering salt pans. The park's unique geology creates otherworldly landscapes perfect for astrophotography and geological studies.

During rare wet seasons, temporary vernal pools erupt with fairy shrimp and wildflower superblooms. Rangers offer moonlit "flash flood ecology tours" demonstrating how this harsh environment supports resilient lifeforms.
