## Park Description
Azure Mangrove Wilderness safeguards critical nursery habitats for manatees, tarpon, and roseate spoonbills. The park's labyrinthine waterways require skilled navigation through prop-root tunnels that filter coastal waters.

Twice-daily tidal fluctuations reveal hidden sandbars perfect for shelling. The park's "Silent Paddler" program teaches eco-friendly kayaking techniques to minimize wildlife disturbance.
