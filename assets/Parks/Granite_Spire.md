## Park Description
Granite Spire Alpine Sanctuary protects North America's largest contiguous alpine ecosystem above 11,000 feet. The park's "sky islands" host unique microclimates supporting pikas, bighorn sheep, and ancient bristlecone pines.

Technical mountaineering routes challenge experienced climbers, while wildflower meadows below offer gentle hikes. The park's glacier monitoring program welcomes volunteer participation.
